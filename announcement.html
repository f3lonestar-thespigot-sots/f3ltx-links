                    <p>Another great week for the men of The Spigot and SOTS. Sunday saw the conclusion of Movember. Monday was cold and wet but the men turned out anyway and didn't complain (too much) because it was nowandlater's SOTS VQ. We also got to celebrate Drill Pickle hitting the 100 BD milestone. Later that day some men got together to help Golden Nugget retrieve his Christmas decorations. Tuesday we saw Birdie step up to cover for a Q who had a family matter he needed to attend to. Then Chinatown covered for Birdie on Friday. Way to step up, men. On Wednesday, we had a relatively good turnout for the APFT given it was a SOTS day. It was the first one for Backdoor (and his first time running 2 continuous miles!). And the last time Boom-Boom did one, Bill Clinton was president. XD Thursday, with his legs sore from the APFT, Backdoor "stepped" into the middle to mix in Latin dancing with exercises. Birdie had to bigfoot and Boom-Boom did a great job representing him in NOR. Then, the shorty shorts were on display Thursday evening during the Strikes for Tykes event. And it sounds like it was a bit of a slog on Friday morning. Haha. Saturday morning, we had good representation at The Asylum launch, with at least 8 Spigot/SOTS men turning up... ...even though there were a lot of men DR at Camp Olympia and elsewhere. Then we closed out the week with the LTX holiday party. YHC hasn't seen any pics from the party as of this writing... What a week! On we go!</p>
